# red-or-black-game
A basic card game often associated with drinking.

This is my first "real" project in the world of coding as I am extremely new and learning.
This game started as a text based interface, was re-written to be a GUI with Tkinter, now the goal is to develop into a fully fledged app with Kivy.

The game is simple:
There are three basic rounds a player must guess correctly in succession to be able to pass onto the next player.
  Red or Black
  Higher or Lower
  Odd or Even
If at any point the player guesses one incorrectly, they return to the start to guess between Red or Black again.
The game keeps a "Drinks" tally and each time a question is answered wrong, a drink is added to the tally.
Upon completeion of all three rounds the drinks tally is revealed, and the next player begins.
A running tally of the deck of cards is also kept but not shown to the players, in order to make sure the cards dont appear twice in one 'deck', and to suprise the unfortunate player who's currently playing when the deck runs out that they now must add a full vessel to thir current drinks tally.

A simple game that I would be stoked with if i could have it not only running fine, but looking fine also.
Any comments and help are always appreciated.
